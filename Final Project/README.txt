To run the lava lamp simulator enter the following in a command terminal:

$PATH_TO_FINAL_PROJECT_FOLDER/Final\ Project/build/finalproject.app/Contents/MacOS/finalproject

where $PATH_TO_FINAL_PROJECT_FOLDER is the path to where you saved the final project folder on your system.

DISCLAIMER: I have not tested this project on any computer with an operating system other than OSX 10.11. The dependencies to run this project are VTK 6.3.0 (This project does not work with the most recent versions of VTK), and OpenGL. 

VTK 6.3.0 can be downloaded here:
http://www.vtk.org/download/

The source code for the project can be found in the file finalproject.cxx
